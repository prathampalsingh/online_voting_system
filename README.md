(steps to run are provided at the bottom)

 The introduction of an online voting system aims to provide a more convenient and efficient way for citizens to
participate in elections. With paper-based voting systems, it can be difficult to locate specific candidates and
ensure voter eligibility. It also made hectic and rush for voters to visit the Centre and vote the candidate. An
online voting system addresses these issues by providing secure authentication and verification mechanisms,
making the voting process more automated and streamlined.
